# Multipart File Uploader Demo

This project was developed with the intent of learning how to upload files in using Multipart Files.

## Assumptions

For simplicity's sake, I have decided to package this project into a mono repo. This makes it easier to build and spin up each container quickly due to the use of `npm` scripts. However, each individual project is a docker container so, each project could be easily converted into a microservice architecture.

For distributed systems, where the backend is replicated N times across N regions, it is best to utilize a shared Cloud Object Storage solution that is mounted at `/tmp` on the backend via Docker. This would eliminate the possibility of a chunk ending up on the wrong replica of the service and that service attempting to decompress the file even though the file is incomplete and the remaining chunks are on a different replica of the service. If a different replica is chosen by the load balancer, then that replica would be utilizing the same storage medium as the other N replicas.

## Development

It is highly recommended that if you would like to develop this project further, you should navigate into each project directory individually and run the development commands specified in their respective README in separate terminal sessions.

I also highly recommend [WebStorm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for developing any Node or React-based applications as well as [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) for developing any Java-based applications.

### Requirements

- [Docker](http://docker.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [Java JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)

## Running

From this directory build the project:

```bash
# It will automatically install dependencies
# prior to building the project.
pnpm build
```

## Docker

From this directory execute the following command:

```bash
# This will build each of the docker containers
# and will spin them up in the background.
pnpm docker
```

Give it a few minutes to bring up the [front-end](/front-end) container. `webpack` production builds can be slow.
