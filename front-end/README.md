## Docker

To docker-ize this application I followed the following guide [dockerizing-a-react-app](https://mherman.org/blog/dockerizing-a-react-app/).

To build and launch the docker container for *development* use:

```bash
make build-dev start-dev-container
```

Then you can access the application at <http://localhost:3001>.

To build and launch the docker container for *production* use:

```bash
make build-prod start-prod-container
```

Then you can access the application at <http://localhost:1337>.
